You have a histogram. Try to find size of the biggest rectangle you can build out of the histogram bars.

Input: List of all rectangles hights in histogram
Output: Area of the biggest rectangle
Example:
largest_histogram([5]) == 5
largest_histogram([5, 3]) == 6
largest_histogram([1, 1, 4, 1]) == 4
largest_histogram([1, 1, 3, 1]) == 4
largest_histogram([2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3]) == 8
How it is used: There is no way the solution you come up with will be any useful in a real life. Just have some fun here.
Precondition:
0 < len(data) < 1000
